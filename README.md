mimport
=======

mimport is a small, currently command-line application that is designed to
import new albums into iTunes libraries.

INPUT: a directory containing music files

EFFECT: copy album to a folder designated by tags and add to iTunes

This is currently just a one-off script. The code is basic and ugly, but I have
plans to turn it into something more usable. I'd love to turn it into a 
[Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com) app, and possibly give it FTP functionality
to access my backups. But for now, it's just an ugly script.
